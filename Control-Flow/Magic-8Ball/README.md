# Introduction
The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.

## Details
The `magic8.py` is a Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

The program will prompt for your name followed by a question. The following are the 16 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

1. Yes - definitely!
2. It is decidedly so
3. Without a doubt
4. Reply hazy, try again
5. Ask again later
6. Better not tell you now
7. My sources say no
8. Outlook not so good
9. Very doubtful
10. I hate to be the bearer of bad news
11. Absolutely!
12. Things are quite unclear
13. Ask a different question
14. Not to be mean but, try asking something realistic
15. Hmmm... do you really want to know?
16. No...

The output of the program will have the following format:

```
[Name] asks: [Question]
Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]
