# Introduction

A compilation of small projects/scripts following my journey with learning concepts of the Python programming language.

## Details
Each sub-folder holds a `README.md` file with details for that project/script, packages necessary and execution details.

## Notes
In Python, there are many different ways of classifying errors, but here are some common ones:

1. SyntaxError: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
2. NameError: Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown.
3. TypeError: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
